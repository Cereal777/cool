    <h3>Hestia, the Greek goddess of the hearth, home, and family, is known for her quiet, gentle nature and her dedication to maintaining order and peace. While she doesn't have a lot of individual myths, she plays a key role in various stories, including those involving her birth and her role in the Olympian hierarchy. 
        <br>
        <br>
    </h3>
    <h4>Birth and Early Life:</h4>Hestia was the firstborn child of the Titans Rhea and Cronus, but was also the first to be swallowed by Cronus.
    After Zeus forced Cronus to regurgitate his siblings, Hestia was the last to be released, making her both the oldest and youngest.
    This mythic inversion highlights her unique position within the Olympian family. 
    <br>
   <br> <h4>Vow of Virginity:</h4>Both Apollo and Poseidon desired to marry Hestia, but she refused, fearing that choosing one over the other would cause conflict.
   She swore to remain an eternal virgin, ensuring peace on Mount Olympus.
   Zeus honored her decision by granting her a central place in the home and the first portion of divine offerings. 
   <br>
   <br><h4>Hestia is sometimes associated with the story of Philemon and Baucis, who welcomed Zeus and Hermes into their home and were rewarded with immortality.
    This story reinforces the importance of hospitality and kindness, values associated with Hestia</h4>
    <br>
    <br><h4>In a lesser-known story, Ovid recounts a story where Priapus, the vegetation god, attempted to rape Hestia while she slept in the woods. 
        The story highlights Hestia's virginity and the consequences of disrespecting it. 
        Priapus was banished from Mount Olympus after the incident. </h4>

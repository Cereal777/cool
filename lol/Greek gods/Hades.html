   <p>  Hades is king of the underworld, is a figure in mythology known for ruling the realm of the dead and for his abduction of Persephone. He was also involved in various other myths, including encounters with heroes like Heracles and Theseus. Heracles, one of the most powerful heroes in Greek mythology, was tasked with retrieving Cerberus, the three-headed dog guarding the entrance to the underworld, as one of his twelve labors. Hades, though initially reluctant, agreed to Heracles's request, allowing him to bring Cerberus to the upper world. </p>

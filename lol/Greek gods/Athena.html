    <p>Athena is the goddess of wisdom. Athena emerged fully grown and armed from the head of her father, Zeus, after he swallowed his pregnant wife, Metis. This unique birth story is often associated with Athena's wisdom and strategic mind. 
    Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron deity of Athens, and Athena won by offering the city an olive tree, while Poseidon offered a saltwater spring. </p>

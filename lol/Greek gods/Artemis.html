    <p> Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt, moon, and wild animals, is known for her strong will and her association with the wilderness. She is also the protector of young girls until they reach marriage, and a powerful figure in stories of both wrath and protection.After Agamemnon angered Artemis by killing a sacred deer, she demanded his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice. In some versions, Artemis replaced Iphigenia with a deer at the last moment.  </p>

    <p>     Zeus is the king of the gods,lord of the sky, and throws thunder bolts, but Zeus only earned this title when he beat his father Kronos after being saved by his mother after Kronos tried to eat him because there was a prophecy about how one day his son will over throw him as king of the universe.He was raised by satyrs on Mt. Dirkte on the island of Crete.Zeus grew up to be very powerful, and when it was finally time Rhea his mom told him to infiltrate Kronos's castle once he did that he ambushed kronos and popped the rest of kronos's children out of his belly and with their help beat the Titan Kronos. </p>

    <p> Posideon is god of the ocean. He is older than zeus. Poseidon initially helped the Greeks in the war against the Trojans because of a grudge against Laomedon, the Trojan king, who had refused to pay him for building the walls of Troy. He later allied with the Greeks, even against Zeus's wishes, to aid them.After the Trojian War ended Odysseus blinded Poseidon's son, Polyphemus, a Cyclops, during his voyage home after the Trojan War. This act of aggression incited Poseidon's fury, and he tormented Odysseus for years, causing storms and shipwrecks as Odysseus attempted to return to Ithaca.  </p>

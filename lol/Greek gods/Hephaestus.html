  <h3>Hephaestus, the Greek god of blacksmiths and fire, is known for his exceptional craftsmanship and often found in stories that involve his skills and his troubled relationships with his family and other gods. One common story tells of his birth and exile, where he is either thrown from Olympus by Hera or Zeus due to his physical imperfections. Another prominent story involves his marriage to Aphrodite and her infidelity with Ares, leading to his invention of an invisible net to trap them. He also plays a significant role in the Trojan War, crafting armor for both the Achaean and Trojan forces.</h3>
